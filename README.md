## ✦ Overview

This project is a **minimalist, modular chromosome modeling system** created for classroom biology instruction. While it originated as a school project, it is intentionally structured to be **open and reusable** by students, educators, and makers.

The design prioritizes **conceptual clarity over visual complexity**. Every component serves a specific instructional purpose, allowing learners to focus on genetics rather than decorative detail.

---

## ✦ Learning Objectives

These models are designed to support instruction and visualization of:

* **Monohybrid crosses**
* **Dihybrid crosses**
* **Allele combinations**
* **Independent assortment**
* **Genetic recombination (crossing over)**

Unlike static diagrams, the interchangeable components allow students to **physically manipulate genetic material**, reinforcing abstract concepts through motion and structure.

### Core Principles

* **Modularity** — all parts are independent and swappable
* **Minimalism** — simple geometry for fast printing and clear meaning
* **Interactivity** — magnets enable movement, recombination, and display

### Key Features

* Separate chromosome **bodies** and **ends**
* **Interchangeable ends** for modeling recombination
* **Magnetic attachment** for:

  * End‑to‑body connections
  * End‑to‑end swapping
  * Mounting on whiteboards
* Fabrication‑friendly geometry (no supports required depending on slicer settings)

## ✦ Sizes & Color Coding

| Feature | Description                                                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sizes   | Three sizes to represent scale or distinguish homologous pairs |
| Colors  | Red and Blue                                                   |

Color differentiation allows easy representation of chromosomes from **different parents** during crosses.

---

## ✦ Component Breakdown (Per Set)

Each full set contains:

* Chromosome body pieces
* **6 interchangeable ends per set**
* Embedded magnets enabling:

  * Structural attachment
  * Genetic recombination modeling
  * Whiteboard mounting

---

## ✦ Magnet Specifications

| Property | Value            |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Type     | Neodymium        |
| Size     | **10 mm × 2 mm** |

> **Assembly note:** Maintain consistent magnet polarity during installation to prevent repulsion between parts.

---

## ✦ Example Classroom Workflow

1. Assign **red chromosomes** to one parent and **blue chromosomes** to the other
2. Mount chromosome bodies to a whiteboard using magnets
3. Attach labeled ends representing alleles (A, a, B, b, etc.)
4. Perform monohybrid or dihybrid crosses by rearranging ends
5. Swap ends between chromosomes to demonstrate recombination

This workflow encourages participation, discussion, and real‑time correction.

## ✦ Modification & Replication

This project is intentionally designed to be:

* **Modified** — adjust scale, labels, or geometry
* **Re‑fabricated** — compatible with common FDM 3D printers
* **Replicated** — suitable for full classroom sets

Educators and students are encouraged to remix the design to match their curriculum or teaching style.

## ✦ Intended Audience

* High school biology courses
* Introductory genetics classes
* STEM education programs
* Educators seeking physical teaching aids
* Students building instructional models
